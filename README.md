# Chip 8 Emulator

I wanted to learn how emulators are made so I designed my own. Chip 8 seems like a good place to start. It was designed in the 1970s and has been used several computers. Technically this is more of
an interpreter, but these has few opocodes to code in so this is an easier place to start.

## Technology

Written in Javascript and uses the JS Blessed library to display graphics in the terminal

## Set up and Run

First install dependencies

``` 

npm i

```

To play run the play command with an agrument of the game you wish to play

``` 
npm run play <game>

```

These controls are mapped to the following.
